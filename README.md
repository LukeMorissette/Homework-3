# The Pros and Cons of Lean According to ChatGPT

**Author:** Luke Morissette

## Overview

I wanted to research the development of the programming language Lean. By doing this, I was hoping to understand the strengths and shortcomings of the language compared to traditional mathematical notation. I found that the programming language was developed in 2013 by Leonardo de Moura and his team at Microsoft Research, for formal verification and automated theorem proving. Over the years, Lean has seen significant updates, including Lean 2, which introduced tactics, and Lean 3, which improved performance and expanded the tactic framework. Lean 4, released in 2021, was a complete redesign that enhanced metaprogramming capabilities and integrated general-purpose programming. Despite its strengths, Lean has limitations compared to traditional mathematical proofs. These include a lack of flexibility, as Lean requires every proof step to be fully formalized, making it more rigid and time-consuming. Lean also struggles with expressiveness for certain high-level concepts and non-constructive proofs, and it can obscure informal insights that are often crucial in traditional proofs. Additionally, Leanâ€™s steep learning curve, challenges with large formalizations, and potential loss of mathematical creativity and elegance further highlight its differences from traditional methods. While Lean ensures rigor and correctness, these limitations show the ongoing challenges in balancing formal proof systems with the intuitive and flexible nature of traditional mathematical reasoning.

## Summary of the conversations I had With ChatGPT on the subject

### 1. When was the Lean programming language invented and what was its purpose?
- Developed in 2013 by Leonardo de Moura and his team at Microsoft Research, Lean was designed for formal verification, automated theorem proving, and general-purpose functional programming.
- Lean's primary goal is to facilitate the development of formalized mathematics by enabling users to write rigorous, computer-verifiable definitions, theorems, and proofs.
- Known for interactive theorem proving, Lean allows users to explore and develop proofs step by step, ensuring logical consistency.
- Lean was created to handle large-scale mathematical libraries and formalization, combining automated reasoning with human-guided proof development, making it a valuable tool for both computer scientists and mathematicians.

### 2. What are some notable updates that have been made to the Lean programming language since 2013?
- **Lean 2 (2014-2015):** Introduced tactics for interactive proof construction and type classes for better handling of algebraic structures, enhancing its suitability for formalizing abstract mathematics.
- **Lean 3 (2017):** Improved performance and usability, developed the "mathlib" library for formalized mathematics, and enhanced the tactic framework, making proof construction easier and more accessible.
- **Lean 4 (2021):** Complete redesign focused on performance and scalability, introduced advanced metaprogramming, integrated general-purpose programming features, and improved tooling and IDE support, broadening its appeal to both mathematicians and software developers.

### 3. What are aspects of Lean that are missing?
- **User Interface and IDE Integration:** Needs better visualization tools and improved debugging support.
- **Library and Ecosystem:** Mathlib requires broader coverage, and Lean would benefit from better interoperability with other formal proof systems.
- **Performance and Scalability:** Lean struggles with large formalizations and lacks robust parallelism and distributed computing support.
- **Automation and AI Integration:** More powerful automation and AI-assisted proof capabilities are needed.
- **General-Purpose Programming Features:** Lacks advanced language features and a more comprehensive standard library.
- **Documentation and Learning Resources:** Requires more comprehensive and beginner-friendly documentation, along with enhanced community support.
- **Mathematical Notation and Expressiveness:** Limitations exist in customizing mathematical notation, particularly for specialized fields.

### 4. In what ways does Lean fall short compared to traditional mathematical proofs?
- **Flexibility and Intuition:** Lean's requirement for fully formalized steps makes proofs more rigid and less intuitive compared to traditional methods, where "obvious" steps can be skipped.
- **Expressiveness:** Lean struggles with expressing certain high-level concepts and non-constructive proofs, which are often more naturally handled in traditional mathematics.
- **Time and Effort:** Developing proofs in Lean is more time-consuming and has a steep learning curve, making it challenging for those accustomed to traditional proofs.
- **Loss of Informal Insight:** Lean's focus on formal correctness can obscure informal insights and the elegance of traditional proofs, leading to over-specification.
- **Accessibility and Communication:** Lean proofs are less accessible to those unfamiliar with the system, and its formalism can be daunting for beginners in mathematics.
- **Handling Large Structures:** Lean requires breaking down complex structures into smaller parts, which can be more cumbersome than traditional mathematical writing.
- **Creativity and Innovation:** Lean's strict formalization rules may limit creative proof strategies and exploratory work common in traditional mathematics.
- **Aesthetic and Elegance:** The need for exhaustive detail in Lean can detract from the aesthetic qualities of proofs, making them appear more mechanical.

### 5. Do mathematicians accept and use Lean frequently?
- **Growing Adoption:** Lean is gaining traction, especially in formalization projects and educational settings, where its rigorous structure is valued.
- **Specialized Usage:** Lean is more popular in fields requiring formal verification, like computer science and logic, but is less common in traditional mathematics.
- **Barriers to Adoption:** The steep learning curve, perceived complexity, and cultural factors within the mathematical community limit broader adoption.
- **Community and Resources:** The Lean community is expanding, with increasing contributions, resources, and successful formalizations that demonstrate its potential.
- **Early Stages:** While Lean is becoming more popular, it remains in the early stages of adoption and is not yet a mainstream tool for most mathematicians.
